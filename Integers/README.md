## Examples
Go examples are executed just like tests, so you can be confident examples reflect what the code actually does. If your code functionality changes, your test will fail.

As with typical tests, examples are functions that reside in a package's xxx_test.go files.

You can watch the examples in the documentation inside godoc:
```console
godoc -http=:6060
```
In your web browser you can navigate to http://localhost:6060/pkg/ and check your package documentation with your example.
